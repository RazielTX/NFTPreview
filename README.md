## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Reusable classes and CSS properties

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

### Continued development

Pseudo classes have a lot of potentional and I-d like to get deep into it. Also, I-d like to try this challenge using Bootstrap.
